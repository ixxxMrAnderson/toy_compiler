# A Toy Compiler

* Homework for the course MS208.

* I intended to maintain a decent code style and make some beautiful IR design, but the deadline keeps me from doing so.

* However, I didn't copy LLVM, which is quite a challenge for me.

* IR and register allocation needs to be improved.

* Do not code gentle into that good night.
